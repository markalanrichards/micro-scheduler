# Micro Scheduler

The goal of this project is demonstrate a simple quartz cluster configured independently of the workers.

This may not be far off production ready.

To run this locally execute `docker-compose up --build`

Next steps
* Helm chart?
* Expose config
* Add tests
* Improve UI (maybe an HTML ui?)
* Extend amqp options to other queuing systems like SQS, JMS, etc
* Improve multistage build caching
